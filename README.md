# **Restaurant**

## Project Description

This project was designed with HTML5 and CSS3 to mainly practice **position**.
Despite being a simple one-page site, it is fully responsive for all types of devices. This was achieved with the practice of media queries.

The project is simple and does not have a functionality other than the practice of position. Even so, it has a clear design that tries to show images as a description of the menu and about the restaurant itself. It was also practiced how to design a table and you can see a clear design of the *navbar* as well as the *footer*.
